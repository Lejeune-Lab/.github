## Datasets <a name="data"></a>

In our group, we have created and disseminated multiple open access mechanics datasets for assessing the performance of machine learning models. All datasets are created with open source finite element software [FEniCS](https://fenicsproject.org/), and all are shared under [CC BY SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/) licenses. Please feel free to download and use them for any research or educational purposes!

| **Mechanical MNIST - Uniaxial Extension, Shear, Confined Compression, Equibiaxial Extension** <a name="m-mnist"></a>|
|---|
| **Description:** Each dataset in the Mechanical MNIST collection contains the results of 70,000 (60,000 training examples + 10,000 test examples) finite element simulation of a heterogeneous material subject to large deformation. Mechanical MNIST is generated by first converting the [MNIST bitmap images](http://www.pymvpa.org/datadb/mnist.html) to 2D heterogeneous blocks of material. There are four different load cases provided. |

| **Buckling Instability Classification (BIC)** <a name="bic"></a> |
|---|
| **Description:** The Buckling Instability Classification (BIC) datasets contain the results of finite element simulations where a heterogeneous column is subject to a fixed level of applied displacement and is classified as either "Stable" or "Unstable." Each model input is a 16x1 vector where the entries of the vector dictate the Young's Modulus (E) of the corresponding portion of the physical column domain. There are three sub-datasets with different input property distributions: BIC-1, BIC-2, and BIC-3. |
